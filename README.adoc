Learn how to use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to implement an application with a reactive architecture.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build reactive microservices using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging. You'll also learn how to send messages between these microservices using Apache Kafka. 

=== What is MicroProfile Reactive Messaging?

Temporal decoupling of services in a microservice-based architecture can be achieved using asynchronous communication. MicroProfile Reactive Messaging provides a way to build systems of microservices which advocates responsiveness, location transparency, elasticity, resiliency to failure and temporal decoupling. This helps in enforcing asynchronous message passing between the different parts of the system. See
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_microprofile_reactive_messaging[ MicroProfile Reactive Messaging Specification^] for more information.

=== What is Kafka?

https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka^] is a stream-processing platform that manages communication in distributed systems. Communication is message-oriented, and follows the publish-subscribe model. Kafka allows for real-time stream processing and distributed, replicated storage of streams and messages. A Kafka producer is a client or a program, which produces the message and pushes them to a topic. A Kafka consumer is a client or a program, which consumes the published messages from a topic.

=== What is asynchronous programming?
Imagine asynchronous programming as a restaurant. After you're seated, a waitstaff takes your order. Then, you must wait a few minutes for your food to be prepared. While your food is being prepared, your waitstaff may take more orders or serve other tables. After your food is ready, your waitstaff brings out the food to your table. However, in a synchronous model, the waitstaff must wait for your food to be prepared before serving any other customers. This method blocks other customers from placing orders or receiving their food.

You can perform lengthy operations, such as input/output (I/O), without blocking with asynchronous methods. The I/O operation can occur in the background and a callback notifies the caller to continue its computation when the original request is complete. As a result, the original thread frees up so it can handle other work rather than wait for the I/O to complete. Revisiting the restaurant analogy, food is prepared asynchronously in the kitchen and your waiter is freed up to attend to other tables.

In the context of REST clients, HTTP request calls can be time consuming. The network might be slow, or maybe the upstream service is overwhelmed and can’t respond quickly. These lengthy operations can block the execution of your thread when it’s in use and prevent other work from being completed.

The application that you will be working with consists of two microservices, `System`, and `Inventory`. The `System` microservice sends the system load average data to the `Inventory` microservice every 15 seconds. The `Inventory` microservice keeps an updated list of all the `System` hostnames and their CPU usage properties.

You'll update the `System`, and `Inventory` microservices to use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging for message passing. These microservices run on Open Liberty.

The `Inventory` microservice receives status updates and provides queries for the user. The `System` metadata are persisted here. Because persisting data is not the focus of this guide, the `Inventory` microservice simply uses a Map object to store the data.

== Creating a Reactive Messaging application

=== Key Concepts

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging recommends a design to build reactive applications based on the following main concepts:

*Channel*

A channel is a bridge for transporting messages between different parts of the reactive system. This can be between the service and a messaging-broker, or between two components within the same service.

*@Outgoing* 

`@Outgoing` is an annotation indicating that the method feeds a channel. The name of the channel is given as attribute. For example, `@Outgoing("cpuStatus")`

*@Incoming*

`@Incoming` is an annotation indicating that the method consumes a channel. The name of the channel is given as attribute. For example, `@Incoming("cpuStatus")`

*Connector*

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging uses connectors to attach one end of a channel to another messaging technology and are configured using MicroProfile Config.
Open Liberty includes the `liberty-kafka` connector for sending and receiving messages from Apache Kafka.

== Configuring the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging connectors

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin. 

In order to configure the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging connectors, we need to format the configuration keys as follows :

- `mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.` :- Applies to all channels using the liberty-kafka connector
- `mp.messaging.[incoming.|outgoing.].` :- Applies to a particular channel
- Each channel which is to be connected using a connector must have the connector property defined to say which connector to use

Both the microservices `System`, and `Inventory` contain `microprofile-config.properties`
file. MicroProfile Reactive Messaging uses connectors to connect certain channels to Apache Kafka and setting options on those connectors.

The [hotspot=kafkaConfig file=0]`mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.bootstrap.servers` property defines the Kafka connector for the Open Liberty runtime. The `System` microservice uses an outgoing stream [hotspot=cpuStatus file=0]`cpuStatus` to send messages to the [hotspot=topic1 file=0]`cpuStatusTopic` topic in the Kafka messaging-broker, so that the `Inventory` microservices can consume the messages.

The `Inventory` microservice listens to messages from an incoming stream [hotspot=cpuStatus file=0]`cpuStatus`, wherein the messages are sent by the `System` microservice through the [hotspot=topic1 file=0]`cpuStatusTopic` topic in the Kafka messaging-broker. The [hotspot=serializer1 file=0]`key.serializer` and [hotspot=serializerVal1 file=0]`value.serializer` properties characterize how to serialize the messages. Similarly the [hotspot=deserializer1 file=1]`key.deserializer` and [hotspot=deserializerVal1 file=1]`value.deserializer` properties define how to deserialize the messages.

The [hotspot=group1 file=1]`group.id` defines a unique name for the consumer group. All these properties are required by the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[Apache Kafka Producer Configs^] and https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs[Apache Kafka Consumer Configs^].

The `Inventory` microservices use similar `microprofile-config.properties` configuration to define it's required incoming stream.

== Building the System microservice

The `System` microservice uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to send CPU usage messages to the `Inventory` microservice over Kafka.

The `System` microservice calculates the average system load for the last minute every fifteen seconds. The average system load for a system is calculated by taking the sum of the count of runnable items queued to the available processors and the count of runnable items running on the available processors averaged over a period of time.

The [hotspot=sendCpuUsage file=0]`sendCpuUsage()` method creates a CPU usage statistics for a host system every fifteen seconds. We use [hotspot=flowableInterval file=0]`Flowable.interval()` from rxJava to create a Publisher. We return the `Publisher` from our [hotspot=publishCpuUsage file=0]`@Outgoing("cpuStatus")` channel, which is configured in the [hotspot file=1]`microprofile-config.properties` [hotspot=cpuStatus file=1]`cpuStatus` stream and MicroProfile Reactive Messaging takes care of assigning the publisher to the channel.

In order to develop the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging application using Maven, add the [hotspot=reactiveMessaging file=2]`microprofile-reactive-messaging-api`, [hotspot=kafka file=2]`kafka-clients`, and [hotspot=rxjava file=2]`rxjava` dependencies to the [hotspot file=2]`pom.xml`

== Building the Inventory microservice

#Replace the `InventoryResource` class.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java`
----

[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

The `Inventory` microservice receives the message from the `System` microservices over the [hotspot=cpuStatus file=1]`@Incoming("cpuStatus")` channel with its properties defined in the [hotspot=cpuStatus file=2]`microprofile-config.properties`.
 
== Configuring the server

To use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, we must enable the feature in the server.xml file for each service.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the system server.xml configuration file.#
`system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

Configure the server to enable MicroProfile Reactive Messaging by adding [hotspot=featureMP file=0]`mpReactiveMessaging-1.0` feature element to the [hotspot file=0]`server.xml`.

The `Inventory` microservice has [hotspot file=0]`server.xml` already configured.

== Building the application

You will build and run the `System`, and `Inventory` microservices in Docker containers.

Start your Docker environment.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` and `package` goals from the command line in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
```

Run the following command to download or update the `open-liberty` docker image to latest.
[role='command']
```
docker pull open-liberty
```

Run the following commands to containerize the microservices:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
```

Next, use the provided script to start the application in Docker containers. The script creates a network for the containers to communicate with each other. It also creates containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and all of the microservices in the project.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]

[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startContainers.bat
```
--

== Trying the application

Once the application is up and running, you can access the application by making requests to the `Gateway` endpoint using OpenAPI.

The services may take some time to become available. Check out the service that you created at the
http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui[^] URL.

*Place Job orders*

Make a `POST` request to the `/api/jobs` endpoint. To make this request, expand the `POST` endpoint on the UI and click the *Try it out button*. Copy the following example input into the text box, and then click the `Execute` button. The `POST` request adds a new job.

[source, role='command']
----
{
  "taskList": [
    "Job1"
  ]
}
----

*Check IN_PROGRESS Job Status*

Next, make a `GET` request to the `api/inventory/jobs` endpoint. To make this request, expand the `GET` endpoint on the UI, click the *Try it out button*, and then click the `Execute` button. The `GET` request returns information about the jobs. The response should show that the jobs have an `IN_PROGRESS` status, In case you see a `NEW` status then wait for a couple of seconds and click the `Execute` button again.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "hostId": "ebf3a1801bf0",
    "jobId": "0001",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "taskDesc": "Job1"
  }
]
----

*Check COMPLETED Job Status*

Click `Execute` again and you will see the response with a `COMPLETED` status. In case you see an `IN_PROGRESS` status then wait for a couple of seconds and click the `Execute` button again.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "hostId": "ebf3a1801bf0",
    "jobId": "0001",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "taskDesc": "Job1"
  }
]
----

== Tearing down the environment

Finally, use the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--
