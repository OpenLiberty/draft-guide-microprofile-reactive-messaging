Learn how to create REST microservices with MP-reactive messaging, and Open Liberty.    

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build microservices using MicroProfile reactive messaging. You'll also learn how to send messages between these microservices using Kafka broker. 

=== What is MP-reactive messaging?

Asynchronous communication allows temporal decoupling of services in a microservice-based architecture. MicroProfile Reactive Messaging delivers a way to build systems of microservices promoting responsive, non-blocking, location transparency, elastic, resiliency to failure and temporal decoupling, enforcing asynchronous message passing between the different parts of the system.

=== What is Kafka?

https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka^] is a stream-processing platform that manages communication in distributed systems. Communication is message-oriented, and follows the publish-subscribe model. Kafka allows for real-time stream processing and distributed, replicated storage of streams and messages.

=== What is asynchronous programming?
Imagine asynchronous programming as a restaurant. After you're seated, a waiter takes your order. Then, you must wait a few minutes for your food to be prepared. While your food is being prepared, your waiter may take more orders or serve other tables. After your food is ready, your waiter brings out the food to your table. However, in a synchronous model, the waiter must wait for your food to be prepared before serving any other customers. This method blocks other customers from placing orders or receiving their food.

The Reactive Restaurant application mentioned below is designed on Microservices architecture. The application that you'll be working with consists of five microservices namely `restaurantBFF`, `order`, `servingWindow`, `kitchen` and `bar`. And uses Kafka broker to enable reactive messaging communication between the Producer and Consumer microservices over the messaging channels.

You'll update the `order`, `kitchen`, `bar`, and `servingWindow` microservices to use MP-microprofile reactive messaging for message passing. These microservices run on Open Liberty.

image::reactive-messaging-restaurant.png[Reactive restaurant,align="center"]

The `restaurantBFF` service is a https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html#variation-backends-for-frontends[backend for frontend^] service.
It communicates with the backend microservices on the caller's behalf.

The waiter places a request using the `restaurantBFF` service.

The `order` microservice consumes the request, produces Order messages, and sends them to Kafka on the `food` or `beverage` channel depending on the type.

An Order begins with a `NEW` status. The `kitchen` and `bar` microservices consume and process the order and update the status to `IN_PROGRESS` and `READY` consecutively. There’s a sleep operation in between each status to represent the order processing time, and the status updates are reported back to the `order` microservice via reactive messages on Kafka.

The `servingWindow` microservice contains a list of all ready to serve food and beverages. It consumes these statuses from `kitchen` and `bar` microservices.
Once the Order is served, it’s marked as `COMPLETED` and the status is sent back to the `order` microservice as a message.

== Creating a reactive messaging application

=== MP-reactive messaging key concepts are as follows :

=== @Outgoing
Outgoing is an annotation indicating that the method feeds a channel. The name of the channel is given as attribute.

=== @Incoming
Incoming is an annotation indicating that the method consumes a channel. The name of the channel is given as attribute.

=== Channel
A channel is a name indicating which source or destination of messages is used. Channels are opaque Strings.

=== Connector
Reactive messaging uses Connectors to attach one end of a channel  and are configured using MicroProfile Config.
Open Liberty includes the liberty-kafka connector for sending and receiving messages from an Apache Kafka broker.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

include::{common-includes}/devmode-start.adoc[]

The `order` service uses microprofile reactive messaging to send messages to `bar` and `kitchen` microservices over kafka.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `OrderResource` class.#
`order/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/order/OrderResource.java`
----
OrderResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/order/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/order/OrderResource.java[]
----

`order` microservice creates an Order and sends it to the kafka topic on [hotspot=OutgoingFood file=0]`@Outgoing("food")` or [hotspot=OutgoingBev file=0]`@Outgoing("beverage")` channel.
The [hotspot=IncomingStatus file=0]`@Incoming("updateStatus")` channel receives an updated Order status from the kafka.

If the order is a food, `kitchen` service receives an Order, processes it and sends back all the statuses to kafka on MP-reactive messaging channels.

//Kitchen
[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `KitchenResource` class.#

[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/kitchen/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/kitchen/KitchenResource.java[]
----

If the order is a drink, `bar` service receives an Order, processes it and sends back all the statuses to kafka on MP-reactive messaging channels.

//bar
[role="code_command hotspot file=2", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `BarResource` class.#

[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/bar/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/bar/BarResource.java[]
----

`ServingWindowResource` microservice receives the `Ready` Order from the `bar` and `kitchen` microservices over kafka topics.
Once the order is served, it's marked as `COMPLETED` and the status is sent across to `order` microservice using the MP-reactive messaging.

//ServingWindow
[role="code_command hotspot file=3", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `ServingWindowResource` class.#

[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/servingWindow/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/servingWindow/ServingWindowResource.java[]
----

Each of the four microservices `order`,`bar`,`ServingWindowResource` and `kitchen` contains `microprofile-config.properties`
file, which configures kafka connector with the MP-reactive messaging channels.

[role="code_command hotspot file=4", subs="quotes"]
----

[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/kitchen/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

Rest all the microservices use similar `microprofile-config.properties` configuration.

== Configuring the server

To get the service running, the Liberty server needs to be correctly configured.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
 #Replace the bar server configuration file.#
 `bar/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/bar/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

Rest all the microservices have `server.xml` already configured.

.The configuration does the following actions:
- Configures the server to enable MP-reactive messaging. This is specified in the [hotspot=featureMP file=0]`<feature>` element.
 
[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
 #pom.xml configuration#
 `bar/pom.xml`
---- 
pom.xml
[source, XML ,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/bar/pom.xml[]
----

. MP-microprofile dependency is included in the Maven [hotspot=reactiveMessagingPOM file=1]`pom.xml` file. This is specified in the [hotspot=reactiveMessaging file=1]`<dependency>` element.


== Building and running the application

You will build and run the `bar`, `kitchen`, `order`, `restaurantBFF` and `servingWindow` microservices in Docker containers. You can learn more about containerizing microservices with Docker in the https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] guide.

Start your Docker environment.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` goal from the command line in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models clean install
mvn clean package
```

Run the following commands to build and containerize the application:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t order:1.0-SNAPSHOT order/.
docker build -t bar:1.0-SNAPSHOT bar/.
docker build -t kitchen:1.0-SNAPSHOT kitchen/.
docker build -t servingWindow:1.0-SNAPSHOT servingWindow/.
docker build -t restaurantbff:1.0-SNAPSHOT restaurantBFF/.
```

Next, use the provided script to start the application in Docker containers. The script creates a network for the containers to communicate with each other. It also creates containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and all of the microservices in the project.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startContainers.sh
```
--

The services take some time to become available.
You can access the application by making requests to the `restaurantBFF` endpoint using OpenAPI. 

The Open Liberty server was started in development mode at the beginning of the guide and all the 
changes were automatically picked up.

Check out the service that you created at the
http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui[^] URL.

Expand the `/api/orders` `POST` request to post an Order and click *Try it out*. Copy the following example input
into the text box:
 
[source, role='command']
----
{
  "tableID": "1",
  "foodList": [
    "burger"
  ],
  "beverageList": [
    "coke"
  ]
}
----

Click `Execute` and you will receive the 200 response.

Now Expand the `/api/orders` `GET` request to get the Order status and click *Try it out*.

Click `Execute` and you will see the response with `IN_PROGRESS` status. 

[source, role='command']
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderID": "0001",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "tableID": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderID": "0002",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "tableID": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

Click `Execute` again and you will see the response with `READY` status. 

[source, role='command']
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderID": "0001",
    "status": "READY",
    "tableID": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderID": "0002",
    "status": "READY",
    "tableID": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

Expand the `/api/servingWindow/complete/{orderID}` `POST` request to complete an Order and click *Try it out*. Copy the following example input
into the text box:
 
[source, role='command']
----

0002
----

Click `Execute` and you will receive the 200 response.

Now Expand the `/api/orders` `GET` request to get the Order status and click *Try it out*.

Click `Execute` and you will see the response with `COMPLETED` status for `orderID 0002`. This updated status is cascaded to the `order` microservice.

[source, role='command']
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderID": "0001",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "tableID": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderID": "0002",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "tableID": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

== Testing the service

You will create an unit tests to test the basic functionality of the microservices. If a test failure occurs, then you may have introduced a bug into the code.

// You can test this service manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at the
// http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties[^] URL. Automated tests are a much better
// approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client
// API provide a simple environment to test the application.

// You can write tests for the individual units of code outside of a running application server, or they
// can be written to call the application server directly. In this example, you will create a test that
// does the latter.

// [role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
// ----
// #Create the `EndpointIT` class.#
// `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java`
// ----

// EndpointIT.java
// [source, Java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=comment"]
// ----
// include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java[]
// ----

// This test class has more lines of code than the resource implementation. This situation is common.
// The test method is indicated with the [hotspot=test file=0]`@Test` annotation.

// pom.xml
// [source , xml, linenums,role="code_column"]
// ----
// include::finish/pom.xml[]
// ----

// The test code needs to know some information about the application to make requests. The server port and the application context root are key, and are dictated by the server configuration. While this information can be hardcoded, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Maven [hotspot=defaultHttpPort hotspot=defaultHttpsPort hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`pom.xml` file. Refer to the [hotspot file=1]`pom.xml` file to see how the application information such as the [hotspot=defaultHttpPort file=1]`default.http.port`, [hotspot=defaultHttpsPort file=1]`default.https.port` and [hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`app.context.root` elements are provided in the file.


// These Maven properties are then passed to the Java test program as the [hotspot=testsysprops file=1]`<systemPropertyVariables/>` element in the [hotspot file=1]`pom.xml` file.

// Getting the values to create a representation of the URL is simple. The test class uses the [hotspot=systemProperties file=0]`getProperty` method
// to get the application details.

// To call the JAX-RS service using the JAX-RS client, first create a `WebTarget` object by calling
// the [hotspot=target file=0]`target` method that provides the URL. To cause the HTTP request to occur, the [hotspot=requestget file=0]`request().get()` method
// is called on the `WebTarget` object. The [hotspot=requestget file=0]`get` method
// call is a synchronous call that blocks until a response is received. This call returns a [hotspot=requestget file=0]`Response`
// object, which can be inspected to determine whether the request was successful.

// The first thing to check is that a `200` response was received. The JUnit [hotspot=assertequals file=0]`assertEquals` method can be used for this check.

// Check the response body to ensure it returned the right information. Since the client and the server
// are running on the same machine, it is reasonable to expect that the system properties for the local
// and remote JVM would be the same. In this case, an [hotspot=assertosname file=0]`assertEquals` assertion is made so that the `os.name` system property
// for both JVMs is the same. You can write additional assertions to check for more values.

=== Running the tests

Run tests

Navigate to the `restaurantBFF` directory, then verify that the tests pass by using the Maven `verify` goal:

[role='command']
```
mvn verify
```

When the tests succeed, you see output similar to the following example:
// Since you started Open Liberty in development mode at the start of the guide, press
// `enter/return` key to run the tests. You will see the following output:

// [source,role="no_copy"]
// ----
// -------------------------------------------------------
//  T E S T S
// -------------------------------------------------------
// Running it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT
// Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.884 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT

// Results :

// Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
// ----

// To see whether the tests detect a failure, add an assertion that you know fails, or change the existing
// assertion to a constant value that doesn't match the `os.name` system property.

// When you are done checking out the service, exit development mode by typing `q` in the shell session where
// you ran the server and then pressing the `enter/return` key.

== Tearing down the environment

Navigate back to the `start` directory.

Finally, use the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.sh
```
--
